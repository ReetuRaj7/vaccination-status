I made a project which tracks on how much vaccination has been completed in our country, which updates daily and displays it on the map using GeoPlotting methods in Python. As we all know this is a very hard time for all of us let's hope everything becomes as fine as it was before, soon as possible.
Stay Safe and Get vaccinated!!
